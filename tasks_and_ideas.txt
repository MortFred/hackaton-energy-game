Tasks

- change sliders to capacity input: " xxx GW installed" and as output "~ # of plants"

- Simulating per time step: Add all possible energy capacities up (100% of the fossil capacities and x% of the renewables according to the time series) and then cut down to minimum load according to the priority. Starting from the cutting down: 1 Oil, 2 Coal, 3 Gas, 4 Wind, 5 Hydro, 6 Solar, Nuclear is uncuttable)

- Weeks chosen: 4 representative weeks? Calculate the score first of all for these 4 weeks and eventually extend the internal calculation later on to a year (but still just show 4 weeks).

Scaling:
- For costs: overall_cost = CAPEX_per_W * Capacity installed + OPEX_per_Wh * Wh_produced (<- adding all sources)
              Cost-file for sources will be provided
- Cost scaling: Interpolate the score with cost_per_kWh = overall_cost / overall_Wh_produced for 30cents/kWh is a 0 and 5 cents/kWh is a 100% score.

- For CO2-Emissions: Emission =
